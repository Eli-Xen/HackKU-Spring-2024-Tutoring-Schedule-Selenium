# TUTORING_OWL: HackKU-2024-Tutoring-Schedule-Selenium

**What is TUTORING_OWL?**

TUTORING_OWL takes in a KU student's desired tutoring, and outputs all tutoring sessions that don't conflict with their schedule of classes.  
TUTORING_OWL is built using Python, specifically the Selenium module for web scraping, and uses Firefox browser.  
In the future, we hope to add a more aesthetic UI and allow the user to choose different browsers.  
We also hope to make it more secure, since it does require the user inputting their KU username/password.

**How to run TUTORING_OWL?**  

Run TUTORING_OWL either by downloading/running the .exe file, or by downloading the raw code.
